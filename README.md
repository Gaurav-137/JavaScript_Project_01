ðŸ’¡ Innovative Project Idea: "Cloud Free Tier Explorer" Web App
A simple interactive web app that allows users to compare and explore free tier services from popular cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.). It shows a clean table of offerings, allows filtering (e.g., "storage", "compute", "AI"), and displays pros and cons interactively. You could use HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling (including responsive design), and JavaScript for filtering/searching.
